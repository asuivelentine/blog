In 2 previous posts, [Abstract Types](abstarct-types.html) and 
[Implicits Resolutions](implicits-resolution.html), I have shown how it is 
possible to make the two types and values worlds interact changing the 
return type of a function depending on the input, now is time to see 
how to do some actual computation just type level, and we see at the end
how to put everything together to so something useful. 

I'm going to show a basic example here, if you want to see something 
more complicated type level computation, I suggest you to read this 
blog series: [Type Level Programming in Scala](https://apocalisp.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/type-level-programming-in-scala/)
